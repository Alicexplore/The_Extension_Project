# The_Extension_Project

We created an opening tab and pop-up to-do list about culture ðŸ§

## About this project

Brain is the third project that was completed as a team with Hortense and Driss, where we explored Chrome extensions.
<br><br>
We wanted to start with an opening tab that would bring together several culture-based APIs, such as the MET, 
historical facts in photos, the IMDb's best movie ranking, and a historical figure of the day.
<br><br>
We then decided to add a feature where users could save these informations to their favorites using the "plus"
icon on the thumbnails and access more details about them.
<br><br>
Finally, we thought it would be interesting to add a pop-up to-do list so users could keep track of their learning desires.
